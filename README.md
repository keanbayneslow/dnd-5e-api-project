# Random Character Generator - Dungeons & Dragons 5e

**Live Project:** [Random Character Generator](https://keanbayneslow.github.io/dnd-5e-api-project/)

This project was created as part of the AcademyXi Phase-1 JavaScript module. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. It uses the open Dungeons and Dragons 5e API and provides the user with the ability to generate random attributes for their character and to search the D&D database for information.

## Project Requirements

1. Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a `db.json` file using `json-server`. Your API or `db.json` should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. APIs that are free and require no authorization will be easiest to use. If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to GitHub!

2. Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3. Use at least 3 distinct event listeners (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity. What this means is that, if you had 3 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event, and you would need to add at least 2 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its own unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's `addEventListener()` method. Events embedded into HTML elements and CSS will not count toward the total. Please ask your instructor if you have questions regarding this requirement.

4. Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

5. Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

## About

This project was created as part of the AcademyXi Phase-1 JavaScript module. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. It uses the open Dungeons and Dragons 5e API and provides the user with the ability to generate random attributes for their character and to search the D&D database for information. Designed to test my ability to fetch data from an API and manipulate it, this project is a passion piece with future development in store.

## Getting Started

As this project uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, users need only access the project in their browser via this link - [Random Character Generator](https://keanbayneslow.github.io/dnd-5e-api-project/)
